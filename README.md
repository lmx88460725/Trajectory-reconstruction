Here are the sample data of our proposed MDP-TR method.

“cid” represent the unique id of one individual
“pts” represents the records
“1” represents the record time
“2” and “3” represent the latitudes and longitudes
“4” represents the type of the record.
As for the data types, “41” represents receiving a call or message, “61” represents making a call or sending a message.
